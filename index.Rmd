# Synopsis

-   Nigeria just concluded Presidential elections between February 25 and the next set of elections would be on the 18th of March, 2023.

-   The current Government just concluded it's second and final term and it becomes important to explore and visualize how Nigerians assessed a variety of issues about the outgoing government and the media.  
-   The data is a 2022 survey from Afrobarometer, a renowned survey service based in Ghana that surveys African countries.  


```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here( "final draft graphics", "afrobarometer.png"))
```

## Journey

-   I never realized there's just so much data out there about several things.

-   I am glad to have taken this class as it really changed the way I think about visualizing complicated data.

-   I realized there are many visualization software that I could use to supplement and improve the plots from R (Tableau, Datawrapper e.t.c).

---

##  First Plot: Trust by Institutions

-  At first, I was having some issues with getting a map for Nigeria to plot how trust varied by different states.  

```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("final draft graphics", "trust_president.png"))

```
---
-   After learning plotting spatial data for different countries using the `tmap` package and getting feedback on draft from peers and Dr Cengiz, I was able to create an interactive plot for trust in the President by state

```{r, echo=FALSE,  out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("final draft graphics", "map presdient.png"))

```

---
## Challenges 
-   I  am still trying to fix and adjust the legend.
-   I also need help fixing the labeling so that when highlighted, the correct state will show.  
-   I am open to feedback on arranging the formatting of the dashboard too.

```{r, out.width = '80%'}

knitr::include_graphics(here("final draft graphics", "map presdient.png"))
```

---
## Second Plot: Issue Perceptions

-     After wrangling the data, I created a simple bar plot but I realized `plot_ly` is a great way to make interactive graphs than `ggplotly`. 
-   Perhaps, I am not great at using it. 
-   The one on the left is the first one I made with `ggplot`. The one on the right is the plot_ly.
-   I was also able to implement some of the class lessons on scale, colorblind friendliness and minimal use of ink to only relevant information.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here( "final draft graphics", "Old issue plot.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here( "final draft graphics", "Plotly made issues.png"))

```

## Tentative Dashbaord 

This is what my dashbaord is currently looking like but changes are still being implemented. 

*gif created using `magick` package.* 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
imgs <- list.files(here("dashboard_image"), full.names = TRUE)
img_list <- lapply(imgs, image_read)

## join the images together
img_joined <- image_join(img_list)

## animate at 2 frames per second
img_animated <- image_animate(img_joined, fps = 1)

## view animated image
img_animated
```
